![Design preview for the Fylo dark theme landing page challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

To complete the "Filo Dark Theme Landing Page" challenge on Frontend Mentor, I first analyzed the design, then planned the HTML structure and CSS styles for the dark theme.
I implemented the email form functionality with JavaScript and conducted thorough testing before adding it to my web portfolio,
where I highlight key aspects of the project and provide links to the live project and source code.
